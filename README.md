# go-tg-bot
Telegram bot using goroutines and another github module, that returns random image using unsplash api

in .gitignore i have file named constants, that has BotAcces key and UnsplashAcces token

If you want to develop this code, start from erasing mutex when using channels, because actually you don't need both at the same time, nevertheless i needed to show that i can work with goroutines, that's why kept evertything
